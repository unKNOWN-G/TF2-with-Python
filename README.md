### What do you want to achieve with this course?

- Learning Tensorflow will give me a capability to train a plethora of custom machine learning models and have computations over large dataset faster
- Scikit learn would not be be able to handle large Datasets
- Tensorflow also mostly runs it's operations on GPU. It adds one more reason for faster training
- I heard that tensorflow has a Tensorboard using which we can visualize things that ar ehappening in tensorflow better
- I heard that TF models are eaily deployable over other platforms

In Conclusion:

1. Custom Machine Learning Modelling
2. Faster Computations
3. Tools Like Tensorboard along with tensorflow
4. Easy Deployment

<hr/>

### What Problem will this project solve?

1. My ML training is taking time, this will give a pathway to use more efficient trainied models.
2. Tf easens the pathway in training a model and focus on my premise more better

<hr/>

### Scope of Projects and Applications

I would like to refer tensorflow more like a library or a tool than a particular course all together. <br>
The Project applications are Endless

- Traditional ML Models
- CNN's along with Computer Vision
- NLP
- Recommender Systems
- If you develop model and delploy it on a server, you can use RESTapi Calls and predict outputs for input through UI
- Speech Recognition
- Gesuture controlled Applications
- Real Time Applications
- Reinforcement Learning

### Get an idea about Course on Youtube (Understand What are to be learnt)

Upon a detailed search on Youtube and Web. This is the information I got

- You can divide the Tensorflow a 3 heirarchial API's

  - Low Level (Max Customization)
    - I want to learn low level customization as i want to explore research aspects in ML using TF
  - Mid Level (You can use custom Functions also with few inbuild loss and optimziers)
  - High Level (Very Simple to train + Less Cutomization with lots of options though)

- It is Graph based execution. In which define every operation that you want to execute on a graph and then you evaluate It
- Depending on Versions (TF1, TF2). The way of exceution is chanegd. TF2 a new method of execution is introduced called as Eager Execution
- Tensorboard has scope base visualization

Things to Learn:

1. Low Level TF Api followed by an idea in Mid and High Level API's. Implement the same small using both
2. TF basics
3. Graph Execution
4. Tensorboard, tools associated with tensorflow
